# LLM-Ready Metadata Generator

Welcome to the **LLM-Ready Metadata Generator**! This project provides developers, researchers, and enthusiasts with a simple and effective way to make their repositories machine-readable for Large Language Models (LLMs). By following our method, you can create structured metadata that enhances your repository's discoverability, usability, and value when consumed by AI systems.

---

## Why This Matters

Large Language Models are increasingly used to analyze and process code repositories. However, the lack of standardized metadata often makes it challenging for LLMs to understand and summarize a project's structure, purpose, and key features. With the **LLM-Ready Metadata Generator**, you can:

- **Boost AI Integration**: Provide LLMs with well-structured data that they can easily parse and interpret.
- **Improve Automation**: Enable seamless automation for tasks like dependency analysis, feature identification, and API usage extraction.
- **Enhance Discoverability**: Help your repository stand out by making it AI-friendly for indexing and summarization systems.

## How It Works

1. **Run the Meta-Prompt**  
   Use the meta-prompt provided below on your repository to generate a machine-readable file located at `/metadata/llm_readme.jso`. The meta-prompt is specifically designed to analyze your codebase and output structured metadata in JSON format.

2. **Validate the Output**  
   Ensure the generated `llm_readme.jso` is accurate and aligns with your project structure. Use any JSON validator to confirm the syntax.

3. **Integrate It Into Your Repository**  
   Commit the file to your repository under the `/metadata` directory.

4. **Share Your Repository**  
   Once the metadata is in place, share your repository with the world! LLMs and other AI systems will now have an easier time understanding your work.

## Meta-Prompt

Below is the meta-prompt to generate the metadata file:

```plaintext
You are an advanced language model that has read and analyzed the provided code repository. Your goal is to produce a structured metadata file in JSON format that summarizes the repository for machine consumption. Specifically:

1. The output **must** be a single JSON object.
2. The output **must** be saved as a single file located at `/metadata/llm_readme.jso` (intentionally `.jso` extension).
3. The structure of the JSON object should follow this template:

{
  "project_name": "string",
  "project_description": "string",
  "architecture": {
    "...": "..."
  },
  "features": [
    "string",
    "string"
  ],
  "key_files": {
    "string": "description",
    "string": "description"
  },
  "configuration": [
    {
      "variable": "string",
      "default": "string",
      "purpose": "string"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "api_endpoints": [
    {
      "method": "string",
      "path": "string",
      "description": "string"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "license": "string or object"
}

4. **Focus** on producing only structured metadata — no additional text or commentary outside the JSON object.
5. Ensure the JSON is valid and properly escaped if necessary.
6. If any sections do not apply, either omit them or provide an empty array/object.

Using the repository’s files, codebase, or any provided documentation, fill out these sections as completely and accurately as possible. The result will be consumed by downstream LLMs or automated scripts for analysis.

  },
  "features": [
    "Structured metadata generation",
    "Optimized for AI consumption",
    "Supports standard JSON output"
  ],
  "key_files": {
    "main.py": "Entry point for the application",
    "utils.py": "Utility functions for data processing"
  },
  "configuration": [
    {
      "variable": "METADATA_PATH",
      "default": "/metadata",
      "purpose": "Location where the metadata file is stored"
    }
  ],
  "license": "MIT"
}
```
